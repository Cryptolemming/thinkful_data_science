Category 5, the strongest hurricane classification, defined by sustained wind speeds equal to or greater than 252 km/h.  That is strong enough to blow over most types of buildings located within a few miles of the coast.  In 1998, Hurricane Mitch, a Category 5 hurricane, swept through Central America, the Yucatan Peninsula and South Florida, leaving in its trali a death toll reaching upwards of 19,000 people.  Recent changes in climate are indicating the potential for even stronger storms to come.  Could a 6th, or even 7th Category be added to the scale?  A Category 6 hurricane would bring sustained wind speeds in excess of 290km/h - 314km/h.  At those speeds, catastrophic failures to man-made structures are almost inevitable, regardless of the extent of the engineering.  
Are the hurricanes of today changing, evolving from their ancestors, and if so, how?  Are they becoming more prevalent - stronger - changing in their location of onset?  Exploring answers to these questions will help us start to shed light on what could be in store for the Earth and its inhabitants as changes in climate continue to influence the characteristics and behaviors of storms.
Since 1851 - there have been 2864 recorded hurricanes, 1814 over the Atlantic (1851-2015), and 1050 over the Pacific (1949-2015).  In 2015, there were roughly 3 hurricanes for every 2 that occurred since record-keeping began.  Hurricanes over the Atlantic are over 2.5x more likely now than they were in 1851.  Over the Pacific, 3x as likely than 1949.  Hurricanes are becoming more frequent, both over the Atlantic as well as the Pacific.





	Hurricanes also appear to be moving.  The storms take place on and around the Americas. 












Hurricanes predominantly take place in and around the Americas.

shortcomings of the data and analysis, further questions of this analysis and for the future, especially relating to climate change for more clarity on possible association.

Not only magnitude changes but also direction.  *As a recent hurricane has shown its movement NorthEast.
